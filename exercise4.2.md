## Exercise 4.2 

It's your turn now! 

Create a function called `categorize_and_color` that takes a number as input and returns a character string with the name of a color (e.g., 'red', 'orange' or 'green') based on some logic (decide on the logic with your partner(s)). It's up to you to come up with the logic rules.


All other code is already written for you - just complete the body of the function `categorize_and_color`.
