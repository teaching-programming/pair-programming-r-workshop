#### Exercise 2.1: Create a function that called `is_equal` that determines if 2 numeric inputs are the same. Test if the function works as expected with the tests below. ####

is_equal <- function (____, ____){
  if(_____ == ____)
    return("Yes, these numbers are the same")
  else 
    return("No, these numbers are NOT the same")
}

is_equal(5, 10) # expect No
is_equal(4, 4) # expect Yes 
is_equal(57.9, 57.3) # expect No 

#### Exercise 2.2: Create a few more test cases to determine if your `is_equal()` function works as expected.

# Your code here! 

#### Exercise 2.3: Create a function called `is_divisible` that checks if 2 numbers are divisible by each other and takes 2 numeric values as the arguments. ####

# uncomment the code below to get started 
#is_divisible <- function(____, ____) {
#  if (____ %% ____ == 0 || ____ %% ____ == 0) {
#    return(TRUE)
#  } else {
#    return(____)
#  }
#}

#is_divisible(10, 5) # expect TRUE 
#is_divisible(57, 4) # expect FALSE
#is_divisible(562894, 14813) # expect TRUE


#### Bonus exercise: Now that you are comfortable with conditional statements and multiple arguments, return to exercise 1 and create a function called `unit_conversion` which combines the 4 functions we created into a single function. ####

# Your code here! Should you wish to accept this challenge, otherwise move to exercise 3
