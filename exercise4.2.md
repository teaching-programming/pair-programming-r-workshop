## Exercise 4.1
It's your turn now: Create a function called `categorize_and_color`
It will take a number and return a color. We will use it to programmatically change the colors of a plot. Write it so that based on values e.g.100, 159, 8... you will return a string with a namr of a colour e.g. 'red', 'orange', or 'green' based on some rules. It's up to you to come up with those rules.


All other code is lready written for you - just complete the body of the function `categorize_and_color`.
