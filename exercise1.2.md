## Exercise 1.2: Create a function called `convert_temperature_CtoF` that takes a numeric value (a temperature in Celsius) as the argument, and returns temperature in Fahrenheit

To get Fahrenheit you need to multiply celsius by 9, then divide by 5 and then ad 32.

e.g. 10 Celsius is 50 Fahrenheit bacause  10 * 9 / 5 + 32 = 50

Return values rounded with round( )
