## Exercise 1.1: Create a function called `convert_temperature_CtoF` that takes a numeric value (a temperature in Celsius) as the argument. ----

convert_temp_CtoF <- _______(____) {
  _______ * 9/5 + 32
}

## Exercise 1.2 Now create a function for conversion the other way called `convert_temperature_FtoC`that takes a numeric value (a temperature in Fahrenheit) as the argument. ----

# uncomment the code below to get started 
#convert_temp_FtoC <- _______(____) {
#  (_______ - 32) * 5/9)
#}

## Exercise 1.3 Using your solutions above as a guide, create a function called `convert_length_INtoCM` that takes a numeric value (a unit of length in inches) as the argument.----

# HINT: the inches to cm formula: inches * 2.54 

# Your code here! 

## Exercise 1.4 Now create a function called `convert_length_CMtoIN` that takes a numeric value (a unit of length in centimeters) as the argument.----

# Your code here!
