## Exercise 1.2: Create a function called `convert_temperature_CtoF` that takes a numeric value (a temperature in Celsius) as the argument, and returns the temperature in Fahrenheit

To get Fahrenheit you need to multiply Celsius by 9, then divide by 5 and then add 32.

e.g., 10 Celsius is 50 Fahrenheit because  10 * 9 / 5 + 32 = 50

Return values rounded with round( )
